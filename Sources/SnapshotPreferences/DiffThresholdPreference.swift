    /// Sets the allowed diff threshold for the snapshot on the view.

    /// Use this method to control how much difference is tolerated when comparing snapshots.
    /// With a diff threshold of `0.0`, snapshots must match exactly. With a diff threshold of
    /// `1.0`, the snapshot will never be flagged for having differences.
    ///
    /// - Parameter diffThreshold: A Float value representing the allowed diff threshold for
    ///   snapshot comparison. If `nil`, the default behavior is used.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A view with the snapshot diff threshold preference applied.
    ///
    /// # Example
    /// ```swift
    /// struct ContentView: View {
    ///     var body: some View {
    ///         Image("sample")
    ///             .diffThreshold(0.2)
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
